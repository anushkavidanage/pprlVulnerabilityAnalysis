# Requirements:

The Python programs included in this package were written and
tested using Python 2.7.6 running on Ubuntu 16.04

The following extra packages are required:
- numpy
- bitarray:  https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bitarray

# Running the attack program:

To run the program, use the following command (with an example setting):

## Vulnerability calculation for plaintext databases
  python pprl-risk-analysis.py path-to-plaintext-dataset.csv.gz 0 , True [3,5,12,13] -1 path-to-plaintext-dataset.csv.gz 0 , True [3,5,12,13] -1 2 False jacc plaintext qid frequency

## Vulnerability calculation for encoded databases
  python pprl-risk-analysis.py path-to-encode-dataset.csv.gz 0 , True [3,5,12,13] -1 path-to-encode-dataset.csv.gz 0 , True [3,5,12,13] -1 2 False jacc encoding jacc False tmh 1000 sha2 4 4 32 frequency
